        Dear {User’s first name},
      </p>
      <p>
        Long before we launched the beta version of xxxx in 2019, our dream has been to build a reliable xxxxx not only
        for you but with you and everyone else who trusts us to look after their xxxxxxxxx.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the almost two years that we’ve been around, our journey has remained collaborative and we’ve deliberately
        carried you along as we learned by experience what it means to run a xxxxxx that works for people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through numerous notifications (some of which may have annoyed you), impromptu downtimes and support that could be
        a lot faster, you’ve stuck around and believed in us.
      </p>
      <p class="last-paragraph">
        Thank you, <br>
        The ATC Team.
      </p>
